He had feelings for her and felt guilty for how their relationship ended. Personally, I think guilt is a very strong feeling and can make you fall back in love with someone. It can make you overcompensate for things that are not even your fault. Well, I wish him well and if he went back to her, I hope he’s happy…or not. I really don’t care. Now back to my ex.</span></p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I ended up having more fun than I thought I would. It felt like old times. I hadn’t seen him in a very long time. Occasionally, we would text to check up on each other. He’d want to meet and I will come up with a reason why I can’t. But today when he brought it up again I said why not. I wanted to know what the whole fuss about exes and sparking old flames is. Now I’m glad I did. I needed to be out, I needed to be with someone familiar. I needed to be with someone who knew me. And oh, this one really knew me. He could decode all the hidden meanings in my words. He could tell what I needed even before I knew it myself. He made sure I got all the presents and attention I wanted. Why did we break up then? That’s a story for another day.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">During our time together, he told me something that made me sadder than I should have been. He said one of the days when he suggested that we meet up and I declined, he came to my office to pick me up as a surprise. He wanted us to talk and see if we can work things out. But just as he was about to call me, I walked out of the building and sat in another man’s car (My bf’s at the time). It sounded like a movie, I thought he was joking until he described what I was wearing, the car, what I was holding, and what I did before sitting in the car. So he never spoke about it and never texted me. I was happy and he wasn’t about to wreck that. But I was single now and he wanted another shot.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I have a good relationship with each one of my exes. I don’t think men are trash. Not at all. I don’t clench my fist when I think of any ex and no ex must stay away from me for their own safety. I mean, we only had a bad relationship, we aren’t necessarily bad people. But what my ex was trying to do has happened a few too many times and I was tired of it. I’m tired of people coming into my life, leaving, and wanting to come back again. I know I’m a great person but I can be a bit much so I show guys who I really am, no filters. I don’t spring surprises on you after we start dating. In fact, you even get a better version of me when I’m in a relationship with you. I’m not exaggerating when I say I’m a great girlfriend. I’m the girlfriend you can talk to about anything. I’m the girlfriend who can’t stay angry. I’m the girlfriend who thinks about your needs. I’m the girlfriend who supports your dreams and wants you to succeed. I’m the girlfriend who respects your privacy. I’m the fun one with a touch of seriousness when necessary.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">So why in God’s name am I never enough on the first try? I like to think that I have reasonable exes but I must admit, they come off as pretty indecisive and that’s something I shouldn’t tolerate. You either want me or you don’t. It just feels wrong to leave me and come back after you realize there’s just one version of me. I don’t think I deserve this love pre-race hurdle where I meet a bunch of indecisive guys till I finally meet someone who knows what he wants. Ugh!</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Do I want to give this ex a second chance? In that case, I wouldn’t be starting a relationship from scratch and that could save me some emotional distress. Do I want to break my “never get back with an ex rule?” I did once, I looked for a technical detail that made my current ex, not an ex, and gave him another chance when he came back. Look where that ended me, a heartbreak of a lifetime.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I still don’t get what the fuss about exes is. It seems that the idea of them being familiar is what gets people. Some people say they never have feelings for any ex. Once it’s done, it’s done. I am one of those people. I spent my day with a great guy by all standards and he still couldn’t elicit an emotional or sexual response from me. But hey, there really isn’t anything wrong in getting back with an ex if your heart can handle it. All you have to do is treat the relationship as a new one and let go of the past.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">The decision to move on with a new person or go back to an ex can yield the same result. In love, taking a step backward could equal taking a step forward. Someone new could make you so happy, and so can an ex who’s coming into the relationship with some “you experience”. Someone new could make you not want to live anymore and someone you’ve been with before could hurt you just as much too, if not more. There’s also ex in next, meaning there’s no guarantee your next won’t end up being an ex too. Love is just a chance you take on someone and hope that he or she doesn’t hurt you, at least not willingly. Truthfully, if we think deeply about it, there’s always an ex we still have feelings for and wouldn’t mind getting back together with.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">For me, it just isn’t this ex. So Next!</p>
