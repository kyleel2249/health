I don’t know how I got here, 4 months of being single and I was already drowning in situationships and entanglements. I usually would issue a disclaimer that I wasn’t looking for anything serious and every now and again, I’d slip in a reminder that we are far from being exclusive. But who am I kidding? It always gets messy.</div>

<p>It was all fun till I started feeling a lot of things after spending time with people. Anger doesn’t quite describe it. It’s an extreme and inexplicable feeling of time wasted and unfulfillment. Hanging out with people felt like a job, something I had to do without being able to hit the stop button. It had nothing to do with the people but everything to do with me. On some very rare occasions too, I found myself wanting more. I found myself wanting to get used to how someone made me feel. Those moments were scary, they had to stop.</p>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<p>I say I hate to be alone, but I hate it even more being around people for long. I’m not toxic but I can be some type of way. Staying around people for long brings out a part of me that’s bad for their mental health. But it’s unintentional, I just have a habit of being selfish with my own happiness, especially post-heartbreak. I put myself first and I always choose the easy way out of awkward situations. So, when I started feeling overwhelmed by all the different people and different things I was feeling, the simple solution was to detach. As usual, I didn’t care how the other person would feel.</p>

<p>I gave myself the month of May to break free from everyone, more like break up with everyone. But the more I detached, the more I met new people to replace the people I was detaching from. It felt like I was caught in an entanglement loop. But I still tried, I doubled the pace of the disentanglement. Some were straightforward, blunt, and without any hurt. For some, I wish it didn’t have to end that way. I hate to feel responsible for hurting people’s feelings so I’m still circling round these 3…</p>

<h3>#Guy1</h3>
<p>I told this guy I wasn’t interested in any relationship and killed the friendship even before it had time to develop. But some weeks ago, we got back in touch and I began to see things differently. True. he’s not quite my type of guy, but I have to admit, he is interesting and great company by all standards. Aha! Did I mention that he cooks? He’s an excellent cook and he cooks me lunch and supper every day. For someone like me who hates cooking and has been considered an unsuitable wife material because of it, this guy would have been perfect for me. But I guess it takes more than food, gifts and great company to want to be with someone. Having to tell a guy who genuinely likes you that you’re unable to return his feelings isn’t one of those things that gets easy with practice. Cowardly of me, I did it over text. Remember when I said I choose the easy way out of awkward situations? I meant it. For a whole day he tried to reach me so we talk things over. I really was going to ghost but the guy did deserve better. So yes, we met up and talked. I caught a hint of the discomfort in his demeanour. I could tell he was trying so hard to not come off as overly bothered. I tried to make him stop bringing me food but he said cooking for me is the highlight of his day and who am I to stand in the way of someone’s happiness? Long story short, we are friends who have a clear understanding of where we stand, at least I do. I won’t be responsible for any future hurt and I hope somehow, he moves on from me. I’d love that.</p>

<h3>#Guy2</h3>
<p>My friendship with this guy is 2 boyfriends old. He gave me the clarity I needed to get out of the first relationship and was very instrumental in my healing process after the 2nd relationship. Nothing could ever go on between us, but we spend so much time together it feels like a relationship and I get overwhelmed sometimes with the responsibility it comes with. There’re some emotions invested but the reason we can never be together is beyond both of us. People who know me can identify guys I talk about but nobody knows about this guy and that’s what bothers me about this entanglement. I hate to be with someone I can’t talk about. If I want my next relationship to succeed, then this is a necessary disentanglement. But I fumbled with it, I couldn’t go straight to the point. (I’m beginning to see a pattern here, I’m a relationship coward after all) To be fair, if this was a sexual relationship, it’d have been way easier but this is too difficult. I’m still trying to detach and I think he’s seen through my act. I hope he makes this easy for me. I’d like to move on.</p>

<h3>#Guy3</h3>
<p>This one hurt the most because it wasn’t my plan to disentangle from this guy. In hindsight, I feel I was disentangling to focus on my feelings for him. We’ve been through years of going around our feelings and I wanted to bring some finality to it. No more “will-we-won’t-we” drama. Unfortunately, just when I had broken free from everyone, we drifted apart. Remember when I said I was some type of way? yeah, he noticed. We got in touch and he said some pretty hurtful but somewhat true things and ended with the fact that I’ve always taken him for granted. My heart sank and broke. It hurt like the heartbreak I had just healed from. I could have defended myself more but I didn’t. I like this guy more than he knows it but If he wanted to walk out of my life, I wasn’t going to stop him. Somehow, I have gotten used to watching people I care about walk out of my life.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK9wqtAwnoE" width="559" height="266" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>I’m not all disentangled yet because well, it’s a messy loop but I have better control of the situation now. Disentangling is not a walk in the park but it’s a necessary evil. In the long run, you’d both be grateful someone had the courage to walk away. One thing I’ve learned though, is never to mince words when breaking up with someone. You don’t want to be misunderstood and you don’t want someone sensing some hope when what you really want, is to be free from them.</p>

He had feelings for her and felt guilty for how their relationship ended. Personally, I think guilt is a very strong feeling and can make you fall back in love with someone. It can make you overcompensate for things that are not even your fault. Well, I wish him well and if he went back to her, I hope he’s happy…or not. I really don’t care. Now back to my ex.</span></p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I ended up having more fun than I thought I would. It felt like old times. I hadn’t seen him in a very long time. Occasionally, we would text to check up on each other. He’d want to meet and I will come up with a reason why I can’t. But today when he brought it up again I said why not. I wanted to know what the whole fuss about exes and sparking old flames is. Now I’m glad I did. I needed to be out, I needed to be with someone familiar. I needed to be with someone who knew me. And oh, this one really knew me. He could decode all the hidden meanings in my words. He could tell what I needed even before I knew it myself. He made sure I got all the presents and attention I wanted. Why did we break up then? That’s a story for another day.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">During our time together, he told me something that made me sadder than I should have been. He said one of the days when he suggested that we meet up and I declined, he came to my office to pick me up as a surprise. He wanted us to talk and see if we can work things out. But just as he was about to call me, I walked out of the building and sat in another man’s car (My bf’s at the time). It sounded like a movie, I thought he was joking until he described what I was wearing, the car, what I was holding, and what I did before sitting in the car. So he never spoke about it and never texted me. I was happy and he wasn’t about to wreck that. But I was single now and he wanted another shot.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I have a good relationship with each one of my exes. I don’t think men are trash. Not at all. I don’t clench my fist when I think of any ex and no ex must stay away from me for their own safety. I mean, we only had a bad relationship, we aren’t necessarily bad people. But what my ex was trying to do has happened a few too many times and I was tired of it. I’m tired of people coming into my life, leaving, and wanting to come back again. I know I’m a great person but I can be a bit much so I show guys who I really am, no filters. I don’t spring surprises on you after we start dating. In fact, you even get a better version of me when I’m in a relationship with you. I’m not exaggerating when I say I’m a great girlfriend. I’m the girlfriend you can talk to about anything. I’m the girlfriend who can’t stay angry. I’m the girlfriend who thinks about your needs. I’m the girlfriend who supports your dreams and wants you to succeed. I’m the girlfriend who respects your privacy. I’m the fun one with a touch of seriousness when necessary.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">So why in God’s name am I never enough on the first try? I like to think that I have reasonable exes but I must admit, they come off as pretty indecisive and that’s something I shouldn’t tolerate. You either want me or you don’t. It just feels wrong to leave me and come back after you realize there’s just one version of me. I don’t think I deserve this love pre-race hurdle where I meet a bunch of indecisive guys till I finally meet someone who knows what he wants. Ugh!</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Do I want to give this ex a second chance? In that case, I wouldn’t be starting a relationship from scratch and that could save me some emotional distress. Do I want to break my “never get back with an ex rule?” I did once, I looked for a technical detail that made my current ex, not an ex, and gave him another chance when he came back. Look where that ended me, a heartbreak of a lifetime.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I still don’t get what the fuss about exes is. It seems that the idea of them being familiar is what gets people. Some people say they never have feelings for any ex. Once it’s done, it’s done. I am one of those people. I spent my day with a great guy by all standards and he still couldn’t elicit an emotional or sexual response from me. But hey, there really isn’t anything wrong in getting back with an ex if your heart can handle it. All you have to do is treat the relationship as a new one and let go of the past.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">The decision to move on with a new person or go back to an ex can yield the same result. In love, taking a step backward could equal taking a step forward. Someone new could make you so happy, and so can an ex who’s coming into the relationship with some “you experience”. Someone new could make you not want to live anymore and someone you’ve been with before could hurt you just as much too, if not more. There’s also ex in next, meaning there’s no guarantee your next won’t end up being an ex too. Love is just a chance you take on someone and hope that he or she doesn’t hurt you, at least not willingly. Truthfully, if we think deeply about it, there’s always an ex we still have feelings for and wouldn’t mind getting back together with.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">For me, it just isn’t this ex. So Next!</p>

I had one of those weekends that send you 10 steps back on your healing progress. This particular one hurts because I feel I brought it on myself although it was a classic unintended consequence to a well-intended action. I should have been strong-willed and not have allowed myself to be taken for granted, objectified even!  My head’s messed up and I even hate myself a little bit. I bet I’m not making sense, but I can’t bring myself to talk about it. It’s all on me so I won’t waste your time ranting about it. All I can say is, sometimes the people we love just love themselves more.</span></p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Anyway, being single is hard and I was wondering how it feels for men. Do they go through all the emotional pain we do? Do they cry? Are there regrets? If I’m to judge from my ex’s experience, I’d say it’s a cruise for men. He has a way of being very convincing with his words but very aloof with his actions when it comes to our breakup and how he’s holding up. But that’s fine, guys never really deal with breakups, they just carry on with their lives. Well, today I want to share a friend’s journey and I really want to hear from other guys in the comments section. He’s been single for 5 years and It’s kinda making my 3 months look like a joke but pain is pain lol.  Anyway, read all about it below…</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Hello Candid Viberz (Can I call you guys that? Lol)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;"><span style="color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 19px;">It’s been almost 5 years since I had a special someone in my life. It almost feels like being single is normal. Do not get me wrong, I have enjoyed being single. It gives you a lot of time to get yourself together. But truth be told, no man is an island. I must say that in these past few years, a lot has gone both right and wrong. I have met amazing people, cut some people out of my life, gotten my spiritual life back on track and the list continues. However, one thing I have noticed is that there are those low moments you get that you just cannot seem to come out of, no matter how much you pray, talk to someone, or even distract yourself with other things. It is these moments that you should cherish the most because that is the only time your mind can see the clearest and think the sharpest.</span></span></p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">They say, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”, well this Jack has been dull for a very long time. Just to clarify, I am not trying to say that finding someone special would have made a difference these past years, however, I am not disputing that it could have.  What I am trying to say instead is that, being single or being alone is not all that bad, but if you let yourself believe that it is then you are only making it worse. Let’s talk about the social life, you know, going out and meeting new people. Yeah, I suck at that. It’s not even the going out part that is hard, it’s the meeting new people part. Funny thing is that I am a very social person, but only around the people I feel comfortable around. I am what they call an introverted extrovert. That’s not a thing by the way, but you get my point.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">So back to the love stuff. Am I seeing anyone? Do I have someone my eyes are on? Do I plan to make any moves on anyone? Do I see marriage in my future and all that? Well, no, no, no, and yes. Just kidding, no, yes, no, and yes. I have spent a great deal of time following the whole social norm of the guy being the one to chase the girl to get the happy ending. I have a new concept, if I like you, I will do my best to let you know, but as to what happens after that is completely up to you. I’m tired of putting in so much effort and not getting the same energy back. It really drains your energy when things don’t go the way you would have hoped for. By that I mean when you start having those you know “she’s the one” thoughts only for you to end up being you and yourself back at square one.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">So where do I stand on all this love stuff or dating stuff? To be very honest I do not know. It’s like one minute I want it and the next, I am just indifferent. I am not exactly the talkative type, but I know how to keep the conversation going if I want to or if I am enjoying it. Other than that, it takes quite a lot to get words out of me. It is my self-defense mechanism; it keeps me from spilling too much. I am very picky with whom I open up to because frankly these days, the only person you can ever trust is yourself, and God of course. Anyways I cannot say for sure I like the new me, but I do prefer the new me to the old me.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">P.S.<br />
A certain someone gave me the courage to write this, and I must say this person has been quite an amazing friend in the little time we have known each other. Some friends are for life and some are for a season, always choose what is best for you.</p>

Are you a monster?"></a></p><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px;">Last Sunday I was tricked into attending my 2yr old cousin’s birthday party. I was under the impression that my older cousins were going to be there, and it was going to be a family get-together. When I got there, there were no older cousins, just a bunch of children, over 20 in number. 10 minutes into my arrival, I was breathless and so uncomfortable. I badly needed to leave but I managed to spend some 4 Herculean hours there.  Telling your family you don’t like kids is not something you can say to a typical Ghanaian family. </span></p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Being nurturing is something that some people believe comes naturally to women. But after spending the majority of my childhood, teenage years, and early part of my early 20s taking care of my little siblings, I beg to differ. After all these years, I still don’t like children around me. Sometimes I feel a little bit of resentment because I feel I could have enjoyed growing up better if I didn’t feel saddled with responsibilities. Being female felt so tiring. You’re expected to cook, clean, train, and nurture while pursuing academic or career excellence. It just felt too much to deal with.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate children. Yes, I’d opt out of holding a baby but that’s just because I find them too delicate.  I’ve volunteered at some children-focused NGOs and my YouTube feed is filled with cute videos of babies walking around like miniature drunks. Children are bundles of joy and it’s a delight to watch them play. But that’s where the liking ends. I can’t deal with the noise, their sense of entitlement and I can’t deal with their disobedience and lack of organization. But then again, they are children and so I need to cut them a lot of slack. That’s why I prefer to like them from afar.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">A while ago, I realized I wasn’t the only one who felt this way about children. I was speaking with a friend who opened up about not liking children too. She felt disturbed and wanted to do something about it. Guess what she did, she volunteered to teach Sunday school kids at church. Lol. Well, long story short, she’s still a Sunday school teacher but she still doesn’t like kids (she should stop right? hehe). Now here’s the thing, people aren’t even allowed to say things like this in our part of the world. You can’t say you don’t like kids lest you end up barren.  But here’s what I believe, not liking kids is not the same as not wanting kids. But, if you don’t want them at all too, no pressure but I want 2 boys someday.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Not being nurturing is nothing to be ashamed of, it’s not a defect and thus, doesn’t make you less of a woman. It’s something you can learn, in fact, it’s something everyone can learn regardless of gender. My family bashed me about not wanting to cook (I guess you already get the picture that I don’t do well with supposedly feminine roles) but when I moved out, I haven’t been eating out but hunger hasn’t killed me yet. Certain things come with time and being nurturing is one of them. (A special thanks to all the food channels that saved my life. S/O to Ndudu by Fafa especially Lol)</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Some people are naturally not nurturing and have no maternal instincts. I read that it could be as a result of how they were cared for or not cared for as children. For some, that’s just their make-up. I fall in all 3 categories. There is also the feminist bit where women feel being required to nurture is sexist. But away from that, it’s ok not to be naturally nurturing because fun fact, this won’t necessarily make you a bad mother. If you give birth right now, certain things will come naturally to you, and the roles that don’t come immediately to you, you will grow into. Remember, it can be learned, fret not.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">So breathe, you aren’t a monster because you don’t like children.</p>

<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0.875em; overflow-wrap: break-word;">As usual, I was looking for a dramatic title and I settled on Busy Bae. It rhymes with busy bee, don’t you think? lol. Anyway, I have 3 scenarios for you:</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 1</span></p>
<p>Girl: hey, can we take a trip this weekend?</p>
<p>Boy: Babe, that would have been lovely but there’s so much going on at work. How about I sign you up for driving lessons during this busy period? Or you catch up with friends and I’ll make it up to you later</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 2</span></p>
<p>Girl: hey, can we take a trip this weekend?</p>
<p>Boy: Ooops! You’ve been feeling neglected lately, haven’t you? I’m sorry, I really want to spend time with you but it’s such a bad time for me.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 3</span></p>
<p>Girl: Hey, can we take a trip this weekend</p>
<p>Boy: I’m busy. Work is important. It’s how the bills get paid.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;">

<p>You don’t have to wonder who the girl in the 3 scenes is. That’s me in 3 different relationships having to deal with 3 busy boyfriends. It’s not surprising that I have to deal with that because I’ve always dated up, someone older, smarter, richer, more driven, etc. In the beginning, it’s a turn-on until I find myself spending weekends alone (weekdays are not even up for discussion) with less physical touch and almost no emotional connection.</p>
<div></div>
<div>They say people have a pattern when it comes to relationships. I think it’s true because I’m back again to the busy boyfriend syndrome. What’s different this time around is, I’m no longer in school. I have an 8am-5pm schedule and sometimes I’m so occupied I feel I will breakdown and never recover. So obviously I’m supposed to be too busy to notice a boy’s absence. But that’s not the case. I notice every single minute I don’t hear from him. I notice every time he misses a chance to show some affection. The silence is loud, the absence is felt and it takes its toll on me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YLgIOmtIMUACY" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I cut him a lot of slack. He’s a health professional and so logically, people’s health and lives should be more important than my needs. I get that, but it still doesn’t prevent me from throwing a tantrum every now and then. The importance of his job doesn’t invalidate my feelings. Sometimes he tries but still #MyNeedsMattertoo lol. It’s easier to deal with a busy partner if they at least acknowledge what their absence is doing to you or If they find alternative ways to stay connected. For instance, if they can’t see you, they at least video call you, text you every chance they get and devote some part of their day to talk to you on the phone. When they’re finally able to see you, they do so in a manner that makes you know you’re important and you’ve been missed. The worst they can do is assume that you understand the situation and you would find mature ways of dealing with neglect in a relationship.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you’re dating a consistently busy partner, there are some decisions you need to make. It’s going to sound like bad advice, but you aren’t obliged to stay if it makes you unhappy. You aren’t obliged to take more than you can tolerate. Some people can, so you can leave such partners for those people. My take-home from the relationship scenarios is this, you matter in a relationship and so place yourself first. You don’t have to make excuses for people to your detriment. Sometimes you tell yourself that he’s working hard to create a future for both of you. I can’t say this any louder, whatever effort a guy puts in his job during your<a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i> dating period</i></a> is for him. He’s doing it for himself and not for you two. Maybe this will drive the point home, if you were to break up today, you leave with nothing. All the hours he supposedly put into <a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>building a future for both of you</i></a> and its gains become 100% his. As you can see, I didn’t end up with any of the 3 guys and all the time I tolerated neglect amounted to nothing. You’re just a girlfriend not a wife, so place a limit on things you should tolerate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;">
<p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/aUfAzzsymCtpe" width="480" height="264" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">You can’t expect your boyfriend to choose you over his career. Because again, you’re a girlfriend not a wife but people can pursue a career whilst at the same time, keep a relationship. Multi-tasking is the buzz word of this century and we have technology to make it easier. People really do find time for the things that matter to them so people being helplessly engrossed in work without a way out is so last decade!</p>
<p>I feel like I’m stuck to this pattern of busy baes. Getting a lot of attention would also smother me. I need a balance I’m not getting and I’ve grown past crying for attention. People suggest that to <a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>deal with a busy partner in a relationship</i></a>, you need to get busy yourself. It works to an extent. Men are busy beings as are we. We’re not just people they leave behind at home or people with such an open schedule, we fit them in anytime they have time for us. When you demand attention, they say you’re needy. Maybe you are and it isn’t anybody’s responsibility to fill the emptiness in your soul. So it’s time to not be so needy. True, it’s frustrating always being at the waiting end as you watch him give everything but you attention. Work, family, friends, sleep and maybe you in that order. It hurts to wait for your turn so get busy too as you wait.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;">
<p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/DqSReZdWmjS7K" width="480" height="442" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">
<p>In recent times, I’ve tried to be extra busy. I’m learning to deal with my partner on his own terms. I’m learning to be fine not hearing from him. I give him space to work whilst I also:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">1. Create a reading list/schedule and stick to it</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">2. Create content for my blog</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">3. Have a drink or a meal with a friend (It’s important how you treat friends when you’re in a relationship because in times like this, they’re your consolation)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">4. Have a wild/long Friday night out so I spend a greater part of Saturday sleeping</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">5. Take a trip</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">6. Catch up with family</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">7. Be engrossed in work</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">8. Volunteer for some social causes</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">9. Take some online courses</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">10. I just agreed to be a guest for a tv show, so watch out, your girl is about to blow! Lol</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Staying busy might just feel like I’m masking something. Like I’m delaying some level of emotional pain to a later time most likely bedtime to acknowledge how lonely I probably am. At least even when these empty feelings come, I know I spent a greater part of the day doing something useful then perhaps, I can cry myself to sleep and yearn for a heart massage in the morning.</p>

I didn’t see much of a happy marriage so growing up, my views on marriage have been somewhat unconventional. It is still something I admire from afar though. Someday I’d want to join the club of people who don’t mind waking up to the same face for the rest of their lives. I know it’s not as rosy as it sounds and so occasionally I talk to my married friends for first-hand information on the good and bad sides of marriage. As for ugly, I’ve seen my fair share. I decided to turn it into a series where I encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences on paper. In the coming weeks, I will be running a series called <a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>“Marriage in One Page”</i></a>. It’ll be written by married people and it will cover issues like love &amp; attraction, parenting, finances, expectations, sex, etc. I will post as and when they’re made available. I hope married people can relate and the single ones can pick a cue. The writer of the first episode calls this one: For Better, For Better. Enjoy.</span></p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Hello,</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">When Noks asked me to write about marriage, I wondered which angle to look at it from because let’s face it, Marriage is broad. It has a broader spectrum than penicillin has over bacterial infections. Now before you assume, no, I am not a doctor and neither am I in any of the medical affiliations. But my wife is, so probably it is sexually transmitted.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I am married but I wouldn’t say I have that much experience in it. My first daughter is 5 years and she wasn’t born out of wedlock so you can do the math and guestimate the range.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Many of you have read books on how to make a good marriage. Things to look out for, things not to do, and all that. Some have been to seminar after seminar and the funny thing is when they show us those red flags to note in relationships before we make the <a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>“For Better For Worse”</i></a> promise, we can very easily identify them in other people’s relationships but never in ours. At best, we can only refer back to them after the relationship breaks down.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">From my experience and that of others, Marriage is very predictably unpredictable. The only thing certain about it is that no two marriages are the same. Looking at a couple’s marriage is like looking at a community from an aeroplane several feet above the ground. Everything looks serene, peaceful, and beautiful until you actually get very close to it then you begin to see the filth gathered in green-masked gutters serving as host to anopheles mosquitoes ready to propagate malaria. (My sexually transmitted medical experience won’t let me be)</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Marriage is beautiful but it’s not easy. I said this to someone once and she asked, so why marry then. Well, I don’t think marriage is for everyone. I am married and happily so. In the same way, I have happily unmarried friends too. It is just something you need to make a decision on and get ready for whatever comes with it. Bear in mind that choosing to be married or unmarried comes with its own unique difficulties, but I would prefer to go through those difficulties with support from another. You may prefer to tackle yours single-handedly and that’s fine. Whichever you choose, just be aware of the challenges and make sure you are ready for them.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">I think marriage is a partnership between two people who are both bringing the best of themselves to make the other better. If you are sitting around idly waiting for your Prince Rama X to come and swoop you to the altar and make all your pains vanish for the rest of your life, then I think you’re living in a Soap Opera and you might remain there till eternity. Things are not what they seem in movies because in movies Brian O’Conner would survive any horrendous Fast and Furious Accident Stunt but unfortunately in real life, Paul Walker did not survive his accident. May his soul rest in peace.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">My point is, a marriage is destined to succeed if both parties bring forth the best of themselves. Meaning you should go into it with something to make the other better. That way both of you become better versions of yourselves simply because of the association with your partner. A partnership of two better persons can only yield fruitful and satisfactory results.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">But I didn’t say this partnership would be devoid of problems. Problems are a part of life and being ready to face them shows how mature you are. “For Better For Worse” literally means so and not <a href="https://candidvibez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>“For Better For Better”</i></a> or “For Better For Some Worse”. Marriage is a wonderful but challenging institution so if you think you are ready then you better suit up because you are in for surprises every step of the way. Very sweet ones and difficult ones as well.</p>

<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Some of us can’t even stand living with our own siblings under the same roof so why should we expect not to be stunned by some actions of our spouses we share a bedroom with. I have learned over the years that the best way to live in a marriage and in any relationship is to adjust continuously. Everything is in motion and so is the relationship hence you both need to evolve continuously.</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Let me introduce my wife to you just a little. She is extremely hardworking. In fact, she can work the home from 6am to 6pm on only two legs. I am not saying she has 4 legs but that too wouldn’t surprise me. But if slouched into the sofa without picking the tv remote, then hmmm, believe me, she would prefer that we both stare at the blank screen than get up to pick the remote. In any case, I prefer picking the remote because there is no way I’m going to stand, bend, kneel, or squat from 6am to 6pm cleaning. I love her. Wink Wink!!</p>
<p style="background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;">Sincerely,<br />
A happily married man.</p>

<h2>How to Get Started with Yoga</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">If you&#8217;re interested in trying yoga, these are the basic means to get started:</span></p>
<p><b><i>Choose your style of Yoga:</i></b> When choosing a style of yoga, consider your physical abilities and preferences. Some styles, such as vinyasa and power yoga, are more physically demanding, while others, such as restorative and yin yoga, are more gentle and relaxing.</p>
<p><b><i>Find a good teacher:</i></b> You can attend a class at a local yoga studio, hire a private instructor, or follow along with online yoga videos. It&#8217;s important to find a teacher who is experienced and has a style of yoga that fits your needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Make it a regular practice:</i></b> Try to practice yoga at least once a week, if not more. Consistency is key to seeing the benefits of yoga.</p>
<p><b><i>Listen to your body:</i></b> Start slow with basic poses and build up your strength and flexibility gradually, and try not to push yourself too hard at first or ignore any pain or discomfort. Yoga should be a gentle practice, self-care, and self-awareness that improves your health, not cause injury. So it&#8217;s important to honor your body&#8217;s limitations and avoid injury.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, yoga is a powerful tool for relaxation and health that has been practiced for thousands of years. Its many benefits for the mind and body make it a valuable addition to any wellness routine. Whether you&#8217;re looking to reduce stress and anxiety, improve flexibility and strength, or simply relax and unwind, yoga can help. So why not give it a try and see what it can do for you?</p>
