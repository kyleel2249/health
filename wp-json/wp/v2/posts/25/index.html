Some people tend to think that I have daddy issues but the truth is, I simply think they\u2019re easily relatable. When it comes to relationships of any kind, I always choose the easy way out. I prefer male friendships to female ones because they\u2019re less dramatic and I keep an <i><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201ceveryone\u2019s friend but no one\u2019s friend\u201d<\/a><\/i> posture. I\u2019m close to a few family members because they\u2019re easy to get along with and they are the only ones I will ever care about. When it comes to men, I feel older people are less stressful to be with. We aren\u2019t talking about any <i>\u201cPapa No\u201d<\/i> level because I\u2019ve always placed a cap on 10yrs age gap and it\u2019s never been about money.

Let me put it out there that I haven\u2019t always gone out for my type. Sometimes I dated the direct opposite of what I wanted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I\u2019ve been with younger guys, I\u2019ve been with guys I felt smarter than, I\u2019ve been with guys with little or no attraction and I have even been with someone who was a financial mess. I\u2019m a stickler for budgets, so to put it mildly, that relationship was a wreck!\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t really concerned about these qualities though, once there was some form of attraction, I could go a few months in the relationship. My previous relationships have always been complicated, undefined, entanglements, or just something to while away time. I believe not every relationship will end in marriage and there are some you just get into for the companionship and the whatnots.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;\"><b><i>Also read, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blogger\/2023\/04\/21\/for-better-for-better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;For Better, For Better&#8221;<\/a><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Anyway, when I felt it was time to be in a committed relationship, I did a lot of thinking. I sat down one day, evaluated all the relationships I\u2019ve been in, identified the patterns, and came up with the similarities in those that made it past 6 months (or 4).\u00a0 That\u2019s how I came up with 8S Theory and it seems to have worked pretty well for me. I\u2019ve never been happier and more fulfilled in a relationship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">It\u2019ll be fair to say I\u2019m painting a picture of a perfect guy but I don\u2019t think these qualities are far-fetched. My boyfriend checks all these boxes in addition to his tolerable flaws and I think an encouraging number of guys can check them too. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t know which S I can compromise on. Spirituality? But I want that because I\u2019m not too spiritual and someone has to bind those demons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I want a smart person because I want someone who will have answers for me when I need them and as a hobby, I like to listen to guys intelligently talk about their jobs. I like a slightly older and mature person because from my experience, dating someone younger or even your age mate forces you to mother someone else\u2019s son and check up on him as though he\u2019s plantain that you\u2019re frying. It\u2019s exhausting. I like them financially stable because this girl here likes to afford things. Whether it\u2019s with my money or my man\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I find myself being attracted to seemingly shy guys. They\u2019re strong, confident, and brave in a vulnerable kind of way. (Does this even make sense?) Sensitive guys are normally in touch with their feminine sides and they can most often understand how I feel. For sexual attraction! If it\u2019s not there, then why are we wasting our time? Bottom line is, I have a reason for every S and each is very important.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; clear: both; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 20px;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\">\n<div style=\"height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 414.398px 0px 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\"><iframe style=\"border-style: initial; border-width: 0px; height: 414.398px; left: 0px; max-width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 740px;\" title=\"period\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/QmJ3dsFsjN0zvN4r2m\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">When you talk about having a type, people think you\u2019re being typical. In fact, people even take offense when you say they aren\u2019t your type. But rather than take offense, why don\u2019t you take a minute to ask what the type entails. If you don\u2019t fit into the category, wouldn\u2019t you be glad you didn\u2019t start something that was going to head nowhere? Or you\u2019d want someone to date you out of politeness? People know themselves and know what types of people work for them. Let\u2019s allow them to express their preferences and let\u2019s take it in good faith if we\u2019re not what they want. If there\u2019s no spark, there just isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">No need to force it. If you don\u2019t have a type too, that sounds lucky yet dangerous at the same time. As in, anything works for you? Wow! Starting today, come up with a list. It might require some Rubik\u2019s Cube-solving skills but it\u2019s totally worth it and it\u2019ll help you avoid avoidable mistakes. If you have a type that\u2019s realistic, I want to encourage you that your type exists.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">So don\u2019t settle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">_____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"color: #383838;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RELATIONSHIP<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LIFESTYLE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CANDID VIBEZ<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #383838;\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LOVE<\/a><\/span><span style=\"color: #383838;\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/b><a style=\"font-family: arial;\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blogger\/search\/label\/candid%20vibez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>\u00a0\u00a0QUALITIES<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial; font-size: medium;\"><b><span style=\"color: #383838;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MARRIAGE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>DIVORCE<\/b><\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>COMPATIBILITY\u00a0 \u00a0 PERFECT MATCH\u00a0<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">_____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I like my men a certain way.
