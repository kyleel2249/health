It is based on the idea that there is a universal life force energy that flows through all living things, and when this energy is blocked or imbalanced, it can lead to physical and emotional problems. Reiki practitioners use their hands to channel this energy to the client, with the aim of promoting healing and balance in the body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 17.12px;\">There are many benefits to receiving Reiki healing, both for mental and physical health. Here are some of the key benefits:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 17.12px;\">Reduces stress and promotes relaxation:<\/span><\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 17.12px;\">\u00a0Reiki has a calming effect on the body and mind and can help to reduce feelings of anxiety, tension, and stress. This can lead to better sleep, improved mood, and an overall sense of well-being. It is a holistic therapy that works on the physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. It uses gentle touch or hovering hands to help release energy blockages in the body, which can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. When we experience stress, our bodies go into a &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response, which releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can be useful in short bursts, but when they are constantly released due to chronic stress, they can have negative effects on our health.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This practice helps to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the &#8220;rest and digest&#8221; response in the body: This helps to reduce the release of stress hormones and promote feelings of relaxation and calm. During a Reiki session, the practitioner will use their hands to channel energy to the client. This energy is believed to flow to wherever it is needed most in the body, helping to release blockages and promote balance. Many people report feeling a deep sense of relaxation and calm during and after a Reiki session. Some even fall asleep during the session! In addition to reducing stress, Reiki can also have other benefits for mental and emotional health. It can help to release negative emotions and promote feelings of peace and well-being. It can also help to improve sleep quality, which can have a positive impact on overall health and well-being. Overall, it is a gentle and non-invasive therapy that can have powerful effects on stress reduction and relaxation. It can be a useful tool for managing stress and improving overall health and well-being.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjRIJSIeKY3UAOkBC733mTQK6MrC4cZpBogwO0CEKCRt88B5PgY8w8pu3rl0I9npPV7BFfQ2a3QfEOO_2kliHuXWtj8R7qgtCm9aesipjc7nrBUJdSK7QWNmZ07OWzOFEi2XsMMYEXkFrbQw0I993codT95mJ-dS1tRmQT2k_CQUs5mQlBW5AdE-yeN\/s546\/Reiki.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjRIJSIeKY3UAOkBC733mTQK6MrC4cZpBogwO0CEKCRt88B5PgY8w8pu3rl0I9npPV7BFfQ2a3QfEOO_2kliHuXWtj8R7qgtCm9aesipjc7nrBUJdSK7QWNmZ07OWzOFEi2XsMMYEXkFrbQw0I993codT95mJ-dS1tRmQT2k_CQUs5mQlBW5AdE-yeN\/w599-h297\/Reiki.png\" width=\"599\" height=\"297\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"323\" data-original-width=\"546\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b><i><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 17.12px;\">Relieves pain and promotes healing:<\/span><\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 17.12px;\">\u00a0Reiki can help to reduce pain and inflammation in the body and can also promote faster healing from injuries and illnesses.
