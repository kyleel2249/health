It rhymes with busy bee, don\u2019t you think? lol. Anyway, I have 3 scenarios for you:<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scene 1<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Girl: hey, can we take a trip this weekend?<\/p>\n<p>Boy: Babe, that would have been lovely but there\u2019s so much going on at work. How about I sign you up for driving lessons during this busy period? Or you catch up with friends and I\u2019ll make it up to you later<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scene 2<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Girl: hey, can we take a trip this weekend?<\/p>\n<p>Boy: Ooops! You\u2019ve been feeling neglected lately, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019m sorry, I really want to spend time with you but it\u2019s such a bad time for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scene 3<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Girl: Hey, can we take a trip this weekend<\/p>\n<p>Boy: I\u2019m busy. Work is important. It\u2019s how the bills get paid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;\">\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/2uIcCCdMYG5twDR3Fe\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px;\">\n<\/div>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to wonder who the girl in the 3 scenes is. That\u2019s me in 3 different relationships having to deal with 3 busy boyfriends. It\u2019s not surprising that I have to deal with that because I\u2019ve always dated up, someone older, smarter, richer, more driven, etc. In the beginning, it\u2019s a turn-on until I find myself spending weekends alone (weekdays are not even up for discussion) with less physical touch and almost no emotional connection.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>They say people have a pattern when it comes to relationships. I think it\u2019s true because I\u2019m back again to the busy boyfriend syndrome. What\u2019s different this time around is, I\u2019m no longer in school. I have an 8am-5pm schedule and sometimes I\u2019m so occupied I feel I will breakdown and never recover. So obviously I\u2019m supposed to be too busy to notice a boy\u2019s absence. But that\u2019s not the case. I notice every single minute I don\u2019t hear from him. I notice every time he misses a chance to show some affection. The silence is loud, the absence is felt and it takes its toll on me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/YLgIOmtIMUACY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I cut him a lot of slack. He\u2019s a health professional and so logically, people\u2019s health and lives should be more important than my needs. I get that, but it still doesn\u2019t prevent me from throwing a tantrum every now and then. The importance of his job doesn\u2019t invalidate my feelings. Sometimes he tries but still #MyNeedsMattertoo lol. It\u2019s easier to deal with a busy partner if they at least acknowledge what their absence is doing to you or If they find alternative ways to stay connected. For instance, if they can\u2019t see you, they at least video call you, text you every chance they get and devote some part of their day to talk to you on the phone. When they\u2019re finally able to see you, they do so in a manner that makes you know you\u2019re important and you\u2019ve been missed. The worst they can do is assume that you understand the situation and you would find mature ways of dealing with neglect in a relationship.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If you\u2019re dating a consistently busy partner, there are some decisions you need to make. It\u2019s going to sound like bad advice, but you aren\u2019t obliged to stay if it makes you unhappy. You aren\u2019t obliged to take more than you can tolerate. Some people can, so you can leave such partners for those people. My take-home from the relationship scenarios is this, you matter in a relationship and so place yourself first. You don\u2019t have to make excuses for people to your detriment. Sometimes you tell yourself that he\u2019s working hard to create a future for both of you. I can\u2019t say this any louder, whatever effort a guy puts in his job during your<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i> dating period<\/i><\/a> is for him. He\u2019s doing it for himself and not for you two. Maybe this will drive the point home, if you were to break up today, you leave with nothing. All the hours he supposedly put into <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>building a future for both of you<\/i><\/a> and its gains become 100% his. As you can see, I didn\u2019t end up with any of the 3 guys and all the time I tolerated neglect amounted to nothing. You\u2019re just a girlfriend not a wife, so place a limit on things you should tolerate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;\">\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/aUfAzzsymCtpe\" width=\"480\" height=\"264\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">You can\u2019t expect your boyfriend to choose you over his career. Because again, you\u2019re a girlfriend not a wife but people can pursue a career whilst at the same time, keep a relationship. Multi-tasking is the buzz word of this century and we have technology to make it easier. People really do find time for the things that matter to them so people being helplessly engrossed in work without a way out is so last decade!<\/p>\n<p>I feel like I\u2019m stuck to this pattern of busy baes. Getting a lot of attention would also smother me. I need a balance I\u2019m not getting and I\u2019ve grown past crying for attention. People suggest that to <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>deal with a busy partner in a relationship<\/i><\/a>, you need to get busy yourself. It works to an extent. Men are busy beings as are we. We\u2019re not just people they leave behind at home or people with such an open schedule, we fit them in anytime they have time for us. When you demand attention, they say you\u2019re needy. Maybe you are and it isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s responsibility to fill the emptiness in your soul. So it\u2019s time to not be so needy. True, it\u2019s frustrating always being at the waiting end as you watch him give everything but you attention. Work, family, friends, sleep and maybe you in that order. It hurts to wait for your turn so get busy too as you wait.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em; text-align: center;\">\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/DqSReZdWmjS7K\" width=\"480\" height=\"442\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">\n<p>In recent times, I\u2019ve tried to be extra busy. I\u2019m learning to deal with my partner on his own terms. I\u2019m learning to be fine not hearing from him. I give him space to work whilst I also:<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">1. Create a reading list\/schedule and stick to it<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">2. Create content for my blog<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">3. Have a drink or a meal with a friend (It\u2019s important how you treat friends when you\u2019re in a relationship because in times like this, they\u2019re your consolation)<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">4. Have a wild\/long Friday night out so I spend a greater part of Saturday sleeping<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">5. Take a trip<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">6. Catch up with family<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">7. Be engrossed in work<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">8. Volunteer for some social causes<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">9. Take some online courses<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">10. I just agreed to be a guest for a tv show, so watch out, your girl is about to blow! Lol<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Staying busy might just feel like I\u2019m masking something. Like I\u2019m delaying some level of emotional pain to a later time most likely bedtime to acknowledge how lonely I probably am. At least even when these empty feelings come, I know I spent a greater part of the day doing something useful then perhaps, I can cry myself to sleep and yearn for a heart massage in the morning.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; margin: 1.75em 0px 0px; padding-top: 0.5em;\">\n<div style=\"clear: both; margin: 1.75em 0px; min-height: 50px; position: relative; width: 740px;\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-src=\"\/\/widgets.wp.com\/likes\/index.html?ver=20230309#blog_id=177516226&amp;post_id=485&amp;origin=candidvibez.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\">\n<div style=\"clear: both; margin: 1.75em 0px; min-height: 50px; position: relative; width: 740px;\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-src=\"\/\/widgets.wp.com\/likes\/index.html?ver=20230309#blog_id=177516226&amp;post_id=485&amp;origin=candidvibez.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\">_____________________________________________________<\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; margin: 1.75em 0px; min-height: 50px; position: relative; width: 740px;\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-src=\"\/\/widgets.wp.com\/likes\/index.html?ver=20230309#blog_id=177516226&amp;post_id=485&amp;origin=candidvibez.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RELATIONSHIP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0LOVE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blogger\/search\/label\/Lifestyle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0LIFE BALANCE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blogger\/search\/label\/Lifestyle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LIFESTYLE<\/a><\/b><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; margin: 1.75em 0px; min-height: 50px; position: relative; width: 740px;\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-src=\"\/\/widgets.wp.com\/likes\/index.html?ver=20230309#blog_id=177516226&amp;post_id=485&amp;origin=candidvibez.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=177516226-485-6448ae5c05fb5\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\">_____________________________________________________<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As usual, I was looking for a dramatic title and I settled on Busy Bae.
