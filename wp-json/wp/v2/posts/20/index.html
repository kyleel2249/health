Are you a monster?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px;\">Last Sunday I was tricked into attending my 2yr old cousin\u2019s birthday party. I was under the impression that my older cousins were going to be there, and it was going to be a family get-together. When I got there, there were no older cousins, just a bunch of children, over 20 in number. 10 minutes into my arrival, I was breathless and so uncomfortable. I badly needed to leave but I managed to spend some 4 Herculean hours there.\u00a0 Telling your family you don\u2019t like kids is not something you can say to a typical Ghanaian family.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/mxRSQpLXBBqhjrOzcW\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Being nurturing is something that some people believe comes naturally to women. But after spending the majority of my childhood, teenage years, and early part of my early 20s taking care of my little siblings, I beg to differ. After all these years, I still don\u2019t like children around me. Sometimes I feel a little bit of resentment because I feel I could have enjoyed growing up better if I didn\u2019t feel saddled with responsibilities. Being female felt so tiring. You\u2019re expected to cook, clean, train, and nurture while pursuing academic or career excellence. It just felt too much to deal with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t hate children. Yes, I\u2019d opt out of holding a baby but that\u2019s just because I find them too delicate.\u00a0 I\u2019ve volunteered at some children-focused NGOs and my YouTube feed is filled with cute videos of babies walking around like miniature drunks. Children are bundles of joy and it\u2019s a delight to watch them play. But that\u2019s where the liking ends. I can\u2019t deal with the noise, their sense of entitlement and I can\u2019t deal with their disobedience and lack of organization. But then again, they are children and so I need to cut them a lot of slack. That\u2019s why I prefer to like them from afar.<\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;\"><p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/E9EN2Ql6NjXO\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">A while ago, I realized I wasn\u2019t the only one who felt this way about children. I was speaking with a friend who opened up about not liking children too. She felt disturbed and wanted to do something about it. Guess what she did, she volunteered to teach Sunday school kids at church. Lol. Well, long story short, she\u2019s still a Sunday school teacher but she still doesn\u2019t like kids (she should stop right? hehe). Now here\u2019s the thing, people aren\u2019t even allowed to say things like this in our part of the world. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t like kids lest you end up barren.\u00a0 But here\u2019s what I believe, not liking kids is not the same as not wanting kids. But, if you don\u2019t want them at all too, no pressure but I want 2 boys someday.<\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;\"><p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1e4CgsRnTQJFK\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Not being nurturing is nothing to be ashamed of, it\u2019s not a defect and thus, doesn\u2019t make you less of a woman. It\u2019s something you can learn, in fact, it\u2019s something everyone can learn regardless of gender. My family bashed me about not wanting to cook (I guess you already get the picture that I don\u2019t do well with supposedly feminine roles) but when I moved out, I haven\u2019t been eating out but hunger hasn\u2019t killed me yet. Certain things come with time and being nurturing is one of them. (A special thanks to all the food channels that saved my life. S\/O to Ndudu by Fafa especially Lol)<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Some people are naturally not nurturing and have no maternal instincts. I read that it could be as a result of how they were cared for or not cared for as children. For some, that\u2019s just their make-up. I fall in all 3 categories. There is also the feminist bit where women feel being required to nurture is sexist. But away from that, it\u2019s ok not to be naturally nurturing because fun fact, this won\u2019t necessarily make you a bad mother. If you give birth right now, certain things will come naturally to you, and the roles that don\u2019t come immediately to you, you will grow into. Remember, it can be learned, fret not.<\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;\"><p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/jF9gFVcrNoN7q\" width=\"480\" height=\"331\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"background-color: white;
