What started as a mere suggestion on saving tips to help guys give their girlfriends befitting birthday presents turned out to have infuriated the guys instead. Reading some of the comments, I wondered if some of these guys had girlfriends. It\u2019ll be disheartening to see your boyfriend\u2019s tweet suggesting that women don\u2019t deserve all that and more. Agreed, Ghc15 a day summing up to Ghc5,475 a year may seem a bit much to spend in one day especially if you don\u2019t have that much to spare but maybe, just maybe this whole thing has been taken out of context. I think all she was trying to say is, put a bit more effort into gifting. Knowing birthdays are an annual thing, it\u2019ll be wise to save towards them just like we save towards every other thing. It\u2019s an investment into your relationship.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I took the discussion to some male friends and I was a bit sad if not angry. Listening to them speak, I realized that perhaps a lot of girls have been forced to accept that they don\u2019t like gifts and all the flashy things that make <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>birthdays special<\/i><\/a>. Guys live under the illusion that girls who expect less or nothing are good girlfriends and for that matter, good marriage material. Let me clear this up for you guys, girls love gifts regardless of what they tell you. No girlfriend is going to get angry because her boyfriend did something nice for her. Even when we say we want a lowkey birthday this year,\u00a0 we still want you to put in effort. Remember when they said women never say what they mean? Yeah, this is one instance.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; clear: both; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 20px;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\">\n<div style=\"height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 444px 0px 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\"><iframe style=\"border-style: initial; border-width: 0px; height: 444px; left: 0px; max-width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 740px;\" title=\"women\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/L0lgGB9vJVFa8\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">God bless the guys who move heaven and earth to put smiles on their girlfriend\u2019s faces on special occasions like birthdays and Valentine\u2019s day. I don\u2019t think it will hurt to remind your girlfriend on 1 day out of the 365 days that she still means a lot to you. The guys who also say they are fine surprising their girls on regular days but not on special occasions, I don\u2019t understand you. You\u2019re bae on regular days and on days when it actually matters, you disappear. In what world does that make sense?<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not equating material things to love but please, and please again, stop comparing current birthday celebrations to our parents\u2019 times. Times have changed and love may have taken on a different meaning. Expression of love has changed. Get used to it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I\u2019m a stickler for (relatively) grand gestures on birthdays and Valentine\u2019s day. I love gifts and I don\u2019t even hide it. Before you crucify me, that\u2019s how I was brought up by the guys I\u2019ve been with and even some male friends. I wasn\u2019t given a house, a car, or anything but I am used to receiving routine thoughtful gifts that make me feel loved. To think that some girls never experience this, not even on their <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>birthdays is heartbreaking<\/i><\/a>. Some guys mask their lack of effort, thoughtfulness, and capability with statements like we have a mutual understanding or my girlfriend doesn\u2019t like gifts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Before you conclude your girl doesn\u2019t like the gifts, attention, and affection, ask yourself if you had anything to do with her decision. Ask yourself if you ever said something that may have caused her to hide her true self. Even if she said she doesn\u2019t want anything too big on her birthday, has it occurred to you that some ex might have made her feel she deserved less and it\u2019s up to you to prove to her that she deserves every time and money you spend on her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Dear girls, before you smile and think this is your piece\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; clear: both; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 20px;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\">\n<div style=\"height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 444px 0px 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\"><iframe style=\"border-style: initial; border-width: 0px; height: 444px; left: 0px; max-width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 740px;\" title=\"drumroll\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l4FGnDqTrkewTIuRy\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">The guys also say they are tired of the scams we present as gifts. They are tired of boxer shorts, vests, socks, shirts, and even sex. Lol, what then do they want huh? Being a girl, I know how difficult it is to come up with gift ideas for guys. I mean, you can\u2019t get it wrong with handbags, shoes, hair, make-up, clothes, cake, dinner, vacation, and a host of other things you can always choose from when getting gifts for girls.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">However, when we get to guys, it\u2019s difficult. What you know your boyfriend actually wants is expensive and beyond your budget. For the things you can afford, you risk being told by your boyfriend that you bought something fake. It\u2019s hard for us but maybe we can consult other guys so we come up with things they will appreciate because believe it or not, guys like the hype and attention too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I once was with a guy who said he\u2019s never received any gift on his birthday before. He even asked me not to bother getting him anything. I did anyway, and seeing his eyes light up as he opened his present was worth every dime I spent. You don\u2019t need to go broke spending on gifts, but put in effort. It turns out they like nice outings, shoes, tickets to events, paying for an online class, and even being posted on our statuses(not the type where he\u2019s the only one viewing\ud83d\udc7f). When you\u2019re on a tight budget, get creative. Some thrills are cheap\u2026\u201d less expensive\u201d if you\u2019re sensitive. Bottom line is, guys go through hell and spend a lot on our birthdays. It\u2019ll be nice to reciprocate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">When it\u2019s time to spend on our significant others and we can afford to, let\u2019s kindly go the extra mile. Let\u2019s try and suppress the thoughts about the worst-case scenarios where we think after all we\u2019ve spent, these people will either leave us or cheat on us. It\u2019s a very toxic way to think in a relationship. May we also not get to that point where we\u2019ve been together so long we begin to disregard important days. Finally, when it comes to gifting in relationships, don\u2019t take the recipient\u2019s word for it. Always give your best and spoil them even if they don\u2019t want to be. Too much is better than too little!<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><b><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">RELATIONSHIP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0LIFESTYLE<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0LOVE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CANDID VIBEZ\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GIFTS<\/span><\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this week GHC15 trended.
