I didn\u2019t see much of a happy marriage so growing up, my views on marriage have been somewhat unconventional. It is still something I admire from afar though. Someday I\u2019d want to join the club of people who don\u2019t mind waking up to the same face for the rest of their lives. I know it\u2019s not as rosy as it sounds and so occasionally I talk to my married friends for first-hand information on the good and bad sides of marriage. As for ugly, I\u2019ve seen my fair share. I decided to turn it into a series where I encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences on paper. In the coming weeks, I will be running a series called <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>\u201cMarriage in One Page\u201d<\/i><\/a>. It\u2019ll be written by married people and it will cover issues like love &amp; attraction, parenting, finances, expectations, sex, etc. I will post as and when they\u2019re made available. I hope married people can relate and the single ones can pick a cue. The writer of the first episode calls this one: For Better, For Better. Enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-323\" style=\"border-radius: 9999px; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; height: auto; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg?w=626\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg 626w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg?w=150 150w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg?w=300 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"659\" height=\"432\" data-attachment-id=\"323\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg?w=626\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"626,417\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/2020\/09\/17\/for-better-for-better\/long-shot-couple-holding-hands-sundown_23-2148297686\/\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Hello,<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">When Noks asked me to write about marriage, I wondered which angle to look at it from because let\u2019s face it, Marriage is broad. It has a broader spectrum than penicillin has over bacterial infections. Now before you assume, no, I am not a doctor and neither am I in any of the medical affiliations. But my wife is, so probably it is sexually transmitted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I am married but I wouldn\u2019t say I have that much experience in it. My first daughter is 5 years and she wasn\u2019t born out of wedlock so you can do the math and guestimate the range.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Many of you have read books on how to make a good marriage. Things to look out for, things not to do, and all that. Some have been to seminar after seminar and the funny thing is when they show us those red flags to note in relationships before we make the <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>\u201cFor Better For Worse\u201d<\/i><\/a> promise, we can very easily identify them in other people\u2019s relationships but never in ours. At best, we can only refer back to them after the relationship breaks down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">From my experience and that of others, Marriage is very predictably unpredictable. The only thing certain about it is that no two marriages are the same. Looking at a couple\u2019s marriage is like looking at a community from an aeroplane several feet above the ground. Everything looks serene, peaceful, and beautiful until you actually get very close to it then you begin to see the filth gathered in green-masked gutters serving as host to anopheles mosquitoes ready to propagate malaria. (My sexually transmitted medical experience won\u2019t let me be)<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Marriage is beautiful but it\u2019s not easy. I said this to someone once and she asked, so why marry then. Well, I don\u2019t think marriage is for everyone. I am married and happily so. In the same way, I have happily unmarried friends too. It is just something you need to make a decision on and get ready for whatever comes with it. Bear in mind that choosing to be married or unmarried comes with its own unique difficulties, but I would prefer to go through those difficulties with support from another. You may prefer to tackle yours single-handedly and that\u2019s fine. Whichever you choose, just be aware of the challenges and make sure you are ready for them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I think marriage is a partnership between two people who are both bringing the best of themselves to make the other better. If you are sitting around idly waiting for your Prince Rama X to come and swoop you to the altar and make all your pains vanish for the rest of your life, then I think you\u2019re living in a Soap Opera and you might remain there till eternity. Things are not what they seem in movies because in movies Brian O\u2019Conner would survive any horrendous Fast and Furious Accident Stunt but unfortunately in real life, Paul Walker did not survive his accident. May his soul rest in peace.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; clear: both; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 20px;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\">\n<div style=\"height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 414.398px 0px 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\"><iframe style=\"border-style: initial; border-width: 0px; height: 414.398px; left: 0px; max-width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 740px;\" title=\"paul walker\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/y64Rd7KWbQuYM\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">My point is, a marriage is destined to succeed if both parties bring forth the best of themselves. Meaning you should go into it with something to make the other better. That way both of you become better versions of yourselves simply because of the association with your partner. A partnership of two better persons can only yield fruitful and satisfactory results.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">But I didn\u2019t say this partnership would be devoid of problems. Problems are a part of life and being ready to face them shows how mature you are. \u201cFor Better For Worse\u201d literally means so and not <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>\u201cFor Better For Better\u201d<\/i><\/a> or \u201cFor Better For Some Worse\u201d. Marriage is a wonderful but challenging institution so if you think you are ready then you better suit up because you are in for surprises every step of the way. Very sweet ones and difficult ones as well.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.growyourvibes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEiHqmKkclAXFzjQAY8yQYmgNASLNSeviMP88gxlu9dK3nkw56Y2xRpBTu7vgTYjQ1AqKbNEhdvghttqgleX2Q7IiQ3pNRrC_W-1MHq5UM11oXg-_gK5XZXarapLZPnpUp2Mnskuk2Wdm3tLFuIpsywY6m7BDmrLcBuZgeJjd4DGamD3U_xROO-hWqmN6A\/w565-h361\/growyourvibes.com_for%20better%20for%20better.jpg\" width=\"565\" height=\"361\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"408\" data-original-width=\"556\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Some of us can\u2019t even stand living with our own siblings under the same roof so why should we expect not to be stunned by some actions of our spouses we share a bedroom with. I have learned over the years that the best way to live in a marriage and in any relationship is to adjust continuously. Everything is in motion and so is the relationship hence you both need to evolve continuously.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Let me introduce my wife to you just a little. She is extremely hardworking. In fact, she can work the home from 6am to 6pm on only two legs. I am not saying she has 4 legs but that too wouldn\u2019t surprise me. But if slouched into the sofa without picking the tv remote, then hmmm, believe me, she would prefer that we both stare at the blank screen than get up to pick the remote. In any case, I prefer picking the remote because there is no way I\u2019m going to stand, bend, kneel, or squat from 6am to 6pm cleaning. I love her.
