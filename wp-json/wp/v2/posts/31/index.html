I sit at my desk on the last floor and I take in the great view for 30 uninterrupted minutes. I look down on people as they go about their activities. Sometimes I think to myself, this must be <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>how God watches down on us<\/i><\/a>. As I look at the day unfolding, my mind wanders and I think about a lot of things. Today, something caught my attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/photo\/young-woman-pulling-suitcase-in-airport-terminal-copy-space-gm1173736603-326125067?phrase=someone%20walking%20and%20someone%20in%20a%20car\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEg3d3XajLixaNn6zj5j2ECb_B69qde9e_DegS3H-2VydPw289AwaOu8YiatzC3rZ69ixGdsPrBxCldWdz3Tg8kbBSuM7UBSWQhsumMX7uJt8ashvhP6tPVMHn5Ozv_97aYBT8AK-O9dMPCCP6uFHjcKlN6oWuNpOgF2AqeZkp5fpi9SHBvIaeGc3MsGDg\/w544-h342\/growyourvibes.com_rich%20kid_poor%20kid_header.jpg\" width=\"544\" height=\"342\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"413\" data-original-width=\"597\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">From where I sit, I see a lot of offices. What I noticed, was the different ways in which young people walked into their workplaces. By young people, I mean people who outwardly look below 30. There are those who drive their own cars to work or are dropped off by their drivers. There are those who from Monday to Friday come in an Uber and there are those who are the trotro besties. Well obviously, there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of the means of transportation I\u2019ve mentioned because we all can\u2019t be the same. But I noticed how differently these people walk. Those that own cars or are dropped off by drivers or Uber walk out of the cars very confidently and feel somewhat important. Even when they are late, they seem not to be in a rush. They get out, take out their belongings from the car, lock their cars and even take a minute to straighten their clothes. When they meet their bosses or older staff on their way to the office, they remain calm and even engage in a chatty conversation as they enter. The trotro squad on the other hand just can\u2019t wait for the bus to stop for them to get down. They quickly get down and start to walk as fast as their legs will carry them trying also to balance their bags and dress up simultaneously. You see them sweating already and on days they are late, they walk like they are spies, making sure nobody in authority sees them.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; clear: both; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 20px;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\">\n<div style=\"height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 843.594px 0px 0px; position: relative; width: 740px;\"><iframe style=\"border-style: initial; border-width: 0px; height: 843.594px; left: 0px; max-width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 740px;\" title=\"tip toeing\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1eEH72j9Cd0VEFosRf\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">This may seem like an unnoticed or belittled trend but generally, rich kids seem to get preferential treatment at workplaces whilst their counterparts have to live in the background. You hear people in authority ask the rich kids questions like how is mummy? Is daddy back from the UK? Where will the family be spending the holidays?\u00a0 Are you enjoying the job? Do you need any help? This seems very harmless on face value but when you\u2019re at the disadvantaged end without a strong self-esteem, you can easily feel depressed and unnoticed. Besides work, nobody cares if you even slept well. It looks like rich kids are even more confident at work. They easily express their opinions and aren\u2019t afraid to stand up for themselves. Sometimes they are less competent than the poor kids but their level of confidence takes them far and makes them daring. They give every opportunity a shot. They will either merit it or their parents will put in a good word. Even if not, the worst that could happen is to go back home to their parents\u2019 riches.\u00a0 For poor kids, you\u2019re your parents\u2019 social security and so failure is not an option. Poor kids are afraid to speak up. They are grateful they even got the job, to begin with and they can\u2019t afford to lose it. When they are being mistreated, they rather endure than speak up. They barely have a healthy work-life balance. They must impress at all cost, even at the expense of their physical and mental well-being.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">There\u2019s a certain level of confidence that money gives you and poor kids may never experience this kind of confidence.\u00a0To be fair, you can\u2019t fault people for being privileged. You can\u2019t dislike someone because he or she has rich parents. You can\u2019t hate someone for having something you don\u2019t. That in plain language is just sheer jealousy and envy. You may have to work twice as hard. You may be passed over for opportunities you are most qualified for, you may fail to exist to the big guys all because you\u2019re from a disadvantaged background. I guess you\u2019d have to be your own fan for a while longer but that\u2019s fine. You should learn to deal with it. Continue to work hard, rise through the ranks and build for your children, the environment you presently lack. Let that be your motivation!<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">This is for the big guys who don\u2019t even realize they are being classist, to be continued\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Ps: Trotro is what we call our public transport in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">\u201cPoor\u201d isn\u2019t limited to just the financially poor.
