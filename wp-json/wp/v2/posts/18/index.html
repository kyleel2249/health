He had feelings for her and felt guilty for how their relationship ended. Personally, I think guilt is a very strong feeling and can make you fall back in love with someone. It can make you overcompensate for things that are not even your fault. Well, I wish him well and if he went back to her, I hope he\u2019s happy\u2026or not. I really don\u2019t care. Now back to my ex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I ended up having more fun than I thought I would. It felt like old times. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a very long time. Occasionally, we would text to check up on each other. He\u2019d want to meet and I will come up with a reason why I can\u2019t. But today when he brought it up again I said why not. I wanted to know what the whole fuss about exes and sparking old flames is. Now I\u2019m glad I did. I needed to be out, I needed to be with someone familiar. I needed to be with someone who knew me. And oh, this one really knew me. He could decode all the hidden meanings in my words. He could tell what I needed even before I knew it myself. He made sure I got all the presents and attention I wanted. Why did we break up then? That\u2019s a story for another day.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjDxX14bKbyYWS62QWl-s8AizrNsadP_GGr0ao_LeCi70rYNacMfw3SL64MRE0NJn6f5_4GHOhHbvLS6cckD94-0nQxvRtdTxrzFkp4N7Yni0Z00HMFBf5HhxR2kwf9cqswiCr5IrO_ZNDdCbCLYjUzKMhBXFh4VFPS-zFkVm06BtA5wIisyGgKBdbBpA\/s1421\/ex%20or%20next.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjDxX14bKbyYWS62QWl-s8AizrNsadP_GGr0ao_LeCi70rYNacMfw3SL64MRE0NJn6f5_4GHOhHbvLS6cckD94-0nQxvRtdTxrzFkp4N7Yni0Z00HMFBf5HhxR2kwf9cqswiCr5IrO_ZNDdCbCLYjUzKMhBXFh4VFPS-zFkVm06BtA5wIisyGgKBdbBpA\/w580-h257\/ex%20or%20next.jpg\" width=\"710\" height=\"290\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"581\" data-original-width=\"1421\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">During our time together, he told me something that made me sadder than I should have been. He said one of the days when he suggested that we meet up and I declined, he came to my office to pick me up as a surprise. He wanted us to talk and see if we can work things out. But just as he was about to call me, I walked out of the building and sat in another man\u2019s car (My bf\u2019s at the time). It sounded like a movie, I thought he was joking until he described what I was wearing, the car, what I was holding, and what I did before sitting in the car. So he never spoke about it and never texted me. I was happy and he wasn\u2019t about to wreck that.\u00a0But I was single now and he wanted another shot.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-661 aligncenter\" style=\"border-radius: 3px; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; height: auto; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg?w=500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg 500w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg?w=150 150w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg?w=300 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"389\" data-attachment-id=\"661\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1609972251478.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg?w=500\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/1609972251478.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"500,389\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/07\/ex-or-next\/attachment\/1609972251478\/\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I have a good relationship with each one of my exes. I don\u2019t think men are trash. Not at all. I don\u2019t clench my fist when I think of any ex and no ex must stay away from me for their own safety. I mean, we only had a bad relationship, we aren\u2019t necessarily bad people. But what my ex was trying to do has happened a few too many times and I was tired of it. I\u2019m tired of people coming into my life, leaving, and wanting to come back again. I know I\u2019m a great person but I can be a bit much so I show guys who I really am, no filters. I don\u2019t spring surprises on you after we start dating. In fact, you even get a better version of me when I\u2019m in a relationship with you. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I\u2019m a great girlfriend. I\u2019m the girlfriend you can talk to about anything. I\u2019m the girlfriend who can\u2019t stay angry. I\u2019m the girlfriend who thinks about your needs. I\u2019m the girlfriend who supports your dreams and wants you to succeed. I\u2019m the girlfriend who respects your privacy. I\u2019m the fun one with a touch of seriousness when necessary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">So why in God\u2019s name am I never enough on the first try? I like to think that I have reasonable exes but I must admit, they come off as pretty indecisive and that\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t tolerate. You either want me or you don\u2019t. It just feels wrong to leave me and come back after you realize there\u2019s just one version of me. I don\u2019t think I deserve this love pre-race hurdle where I meet a bunch of indecisive guys till I finally meet someone who knows what he wants. Ugh!<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Do I want to give this ex a second chance? In that case, I wouldn\u2019t be starting a relationship from scratch and that could save me some emotional distress. Do I want to break my \u201cnever get back with an ex rule?\u201d I did once, I looked for a technical detail that made my current ex, not an ex, and gave him another chance when he came back. Look where that ended me, a heartbreak of a lifetime.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin: 0px 0px 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-662 aligncenter\" style=\"border-radius: 3px; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; height: auto; max-width: 100%; vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=150 150w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=300 300w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=768 768w, https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg 2000w\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"662\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=1024\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1.0.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1200\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/07\/ex-or-next\/damn-it-still-hurts_post-background-image-1-0\/\" \/><\/figure>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">I still don\u2019t get what the fuss about exes is. It seems that the idea of them being familiar is what gets people. Some people say they never have feelings for any ex. Once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. I am one of those people. I spent my day with a great guy by all standards and he still couldn\u2019t elicit an emotional or sexual response from me. But hey, there really isn\u2019t anything wrong in getting back with an ex if your heart can handle it. All you have to do is treat the relationship as a new one and let go of the past.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">The decision to move on with a new person or go back to an ex can yield the same result. In love, taking a step backward could equal taking a step forward. Someone new could make you so happy, and so can an ex who\u2019s coming into the relationship with some \u201cyou experience\u201d. Someone new could make you not want to live anymore and someone you\u2019ve been with before could hurt you just as much too, if not more. There\u2019s also ex in next, meaning there\u2019s no guarantee your next won\u2019t end up being an ex too. Love is just a chance you take on someone and hope that he or she doesn\u2019t hurt you, at least not willingly. Truthfully, if we think deeply about it, there\u2019s always an ex we still have feelings for and wouldn\u2019t mind getting back together with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">For me, it just isn\u2019t this ex.
