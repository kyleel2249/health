Also known as pertussis, this respiratory infection is highly contagious and can cause lengthy and repeated bouts of coughing. But did you know that whooping cough can also have an impact on mental health? In this article, we will explore what whooping cough is, its impacts on Mental Health, symptoms, causes, and what you need to know to protect yourself and your loved ones,\u00a0as explained by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.facebook.com\/samuel.archimedes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i>the Medical Health Professional and Team Lead of Healthy Choice, Mr. Samuel Ntiamoah<\/i><\/b><\/a>.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is Whooping Cough?<\/h2>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/diseases-and-conditions\/whooping-cough\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i> Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium &#8220;Bordetella Pertussis<\/i><\/b><\/a>&#8221; and is <b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ninashapiro\/2018\/09\/14\/to-prevent-deadly-whooping-cough-outbreaks-give-the-vaccine-ahead-of-schedule\/?sh=12da1e445c45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highly contagious and deadly, especially to infants<\/a><\/i><\/b>. The bacteria attach to the cilia, tiny hair-like extensions that line part of the upper respiratory system, and release toxins that damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. It is then spread through tiny germ-laden droplets that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes so hard, followed by a &#8220;whooping&#8221; sound. The disease is only found in humans and spreads easily from person to person through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The condition usually starts with cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, low-grade fever, and mild cough, and then progresses to severe coughing which can be violent and make it difficult to breathe, and can last for weeks or even months. People can be contagious for weeks and can spread the disease even if they don&#8217;t know they have it. Infants and young children are at higher risk for severe complications and hospitalization. In some cases, the coughing can be so severe that it leads to vomiting, exhaustion, and even broken ribs. The best way to protect against whooping cough is to get vaccinated and keep up to date with booster shots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/photo\/shot-of-a-mature-man-coughing-during-a-consultation-with-a-doctor-in-a-clinic-gm1387146927-445164868?phrase=whooping+cough+patient\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4476 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/healthvibes\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/whooping-cough-patient.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"389\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Stages Of Whooping Cough<\/h2>\n<div>\n<p>The stages of whooping cough are as follows:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><b>Early symptoms:<\/b> This stage can last for 1 to 2 weeks and usually includes a runny or stuffed-up nose, low-grade fever, mild, occasional cough, and in babies, apnea (life-threatening pauses in breathing) and cyanosis (turning or purple).<\/li>\n<li><b>Paroxysmal stage:<\/b>\u00a01 to 2 weeks after the first symptoms start, people with whooping cough may develop rapid, violent, and uncontrolled coughing fits that usually last from 1 to 6 weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks. Coughing fits generally get worse and become more common as the illness continues. People may make a high-pitched <i><b>\u201cwhoop\u201d<\/b><\/i> sound when they are finally able to inhale at the end of a coughing fit, vomit during or after coughing fits, and struggle to breathe.<\/li>\n<li><b>Recovery:<\/b> The convalescent phase is characterized by a residual cough that persists for weeks to months, usually triggered by exposure to another upper respiratory infection.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><b>Vaccination Stages<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>According to the <b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/pertussis\/vaccines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<\/a><\/i><\/b>, babies need three doses of the DTaP vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to build up high levels of protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough.<\/p>\n<p>They also need two booster shots, the first between 15 and 18 months, and the second between 4 and 6 years of age. For children aged 7 to 10 years who are not fully vaccinated, the CDC recommends a single dose of Tdap.<\/p>\n<p>For adolescents aged 11 to 18 years, the CDC recommends a single dose of Tdap with preferred administration at 11 to 12 years of age. Adults who have never received a dose of Tdap should get one as soon as feasible, followed by either a Td or Tdap shot every 10 years.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Impacts Of Whooping Cough On Mental Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While whooping cough is primarily a respiratory infection, its direct impact on mental health is limited. However, studies have shown that the illness can cause considerable distress to both the child and their families, especially to parents who can suffer from fears for the life and health of their child and from serious loss of sleep. Two months after admission, the child&#8217;s behavior may still be disturbed, but in most cases, the rest of the family has returned to normal. It is important to note that the emotional impact of whooping cough may vary depending on the severity of the illness and the age of the affected person. Seeking support from healthcare or medical professionals, family, and friends can help alleviate some of the stress associated with the illness.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways that whooping cough can affect mental health:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/324\/7353\/1537.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Anxiety:<\/b><\/a> The severe coughing fits associated with whooping cough can be frightening and may cause anxiety in some people.

This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and social disconnection.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/conditionsandtreatments\/whooping-cough\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Stigma:<\/b><\/a> There is still a stigma associated with whooping cough, and people with the infection may feel ashamed or embarrassed.

Treatment options vary depending on the age of the affected person, and macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are preferred for the treatment of pertussis in persons 1 month of age and older.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to seek medical attention as early as possible before coughing fits begin, as treating whooping cough early can make the illness less serious and help prevent the spreading of the bacteria to others. Managing symptoms at home can also help reduce the risk of spreading the bacteria and improve comfort. However, it is important to note that antibiotics may not be effective if the illness has progressed beyond a certain point.

Seeking early diagnosis and treatment for these conditions can help improve outcomes and prevent long-term complications. Pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated against whooping cough to help protect their newborn babies. Studies have shown that breastfeeding can have a positive impact on the mental health of both the child and the mother. Breastfeeding can help reduce the stress associated with caring for a sick infant and improve the mother&#8217;s mood. Regular exercise can also help improve mental health by reducing stress, improving sleep quality, and aiding recovery from mental illness.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In conclusion, whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection that can have an impact on mental health.
