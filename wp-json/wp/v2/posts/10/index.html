The aura symptoms can include visual disturbances such as flashing lights, blind spots, or zigzag lines, as well as sensory symptoms like tingling or numbness in the face or hands. Other symptoms that may occur during a migraine with aura include difficulty speaking, confusion, and weakness on one side of the body. These symptoms typically last for 20-60 minutes and are followed by the headache phase of the migraine. Migraine with aura is thought to be caused by changes in the brain that lead to the activation of the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for pain perception in the head and face.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/migraine\/guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Migraine Without Aura<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>A migraine without aura is a type of migraine headache that does not involve the specific set of symptoms known as aura. Instead, the headache typically begins as a moderate to severebbing pain that is often felt on one side of the head. Other common symptoms of migraine without aura may include sensitivity to light, sound, or smell, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms can last for several hours to several days and can be debilitating for the individual experiencing them. Migraine without aura is thought to be caused by changes in the brain that lead to the activation of pain pathways and the release of inflammatory substances that cause headache pain. It is a common type of migraine, affecting approximately 70-90% of people who experience migraines.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainetrust.org\/understand-migraine\/types-of-migraine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abdominal Migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Abdominal migraine is a type of migraine headache that is characterized by recurrent episodes of stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting in the absence of a gastrointestinal disorder. Unlike typical migraines, abdominal migraines do not usually involve head pain as a symptom. This condition is more common in children and typically occurs in those under the age of 10. The episodes of abdominal migraine can last from a few hours up to several days and can be triggered by various factors such as stress, certain foods, and changes in sleep patterns. It is important for parents to be aware of the symptoms of abdominal migraine and to seek medical attention if they suspect that their child may be experiencing this condition. Treatment for abdominal migraine may include medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future episodes, as well as lifestyle changes such as avoiding trigger foods and getting enough sleep.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainetrust.org\/understand-migraine\/types-of-migraine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Menstrual migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Menstrual migraine is a type of migraine headache that occurs in women and is linked to the menstrual cycle. It typically occurs in the days leading up to menstruation or during menstruation. Women who experience menstrual migraines may also experience other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Hormonal changes are thought to be a trigger for migraines, and women who experience them may find that they occur more frequently during times of hormonal fluctuations, such as during puberty, pregnancy, or menopause. Treatment for menstrual migraine may include medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future episodes, as well as lifestyle changes such as stress reduction, regular exercise, and avoiding trigger foods. Some women may find that hormonal treatments, such as birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, can help reduce the frequency and severity of menstrual migraines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainetrust.org\/understand-migraine\/types-of-migraine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hemiplegic migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">A hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine that is accompanied by weakness on one side of the body, which is known as hemiplegia. This weakness is a form of migraine aura and occurs with other typical migraine aurae signs like changes in vision, speech, or sensation. The symptoms of hemiplegic migraine are similar to those of a stroke and can be quite severe. There are two types of hemiplegic migraine: familial hemiplegic migraine, which runs in families, and sporadic hemiplegic migraine, which occurs in individuals with no family history. If a person experiences weakness with their headache, they should seek immediate medical attention and not make assumptions about their condition. Treatment for hemiplegic migraine may include medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future episodes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainetrust.org\/understand-migraine\/types-of-migraine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestibular migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Vestibular migraine is a type of migraine that is characterized by episodes of dizziness or vertigo and is often accompanied by other migraine symptoms such as headache, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. Vestibular migraines are caused by a problem in the nervous system and are more common in people who have a history of migraines. The symptoms of vestibular migraine can include a sensation of spinning or movement, feeling off-balance or unsteady, and difficulty concentrating. Treatment for vestibular migraine may include medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future episodes, as well as lifestyle changes such as reducing stress and avoiding triggers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3258393\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Episodic migraine<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Episodic migraine is a type of migraine headache that is characterized by having headaches on fewer than 15 days per month. This is in contrast to chronic migraine, which is characterized by headaches on 15 or more days per month for three or more months. Episodic migraine can be triggered by various factors such as stress, certain foods, and changes in sleep patterns. The symptoms of episodic migraine can include a throbbing or pulsing headache, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea or vomiting. Treatment for episodic migraine may include medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future episodes, as well as lifestyle changes such as stress reduction and avoiding trigger foods.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/migrainetrust.org\/understand-migraine\/types-of-migraine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chronic Migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 107%;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Chronic migraine is a type of migraine headache that is characterized by the experience of migrainous headaches on at least 15 days per month for at least three months. Chronic migraine is different from<br \/>\nepisodic migraine, which is characterized by having fewer than 15 headache days per month. Chronic migraine can be extremely debilitating and can have a significant impact on a person&#8217;s quality of life, leading to missed work or social engagements. Treatment for chronic migraine may include medications to prevent headaches, as well as lifestyle changes such as stress reduction, regular exercise, and avoiding trigger foods. It&#8217;s important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan for chronic migraine, as the condition can be complex and multifaceted.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">It is important to note that not all individuals with migraines will experience these specific types, and some individuals may experience a combination of different these types.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/intl\/basics\/migraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stages Of Migraine<\/a><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Prodrome<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">This stage can occur hours or days before the headache and includes symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, and food cravings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Aura<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Not all migraine sufferers experience this stage, but those who do may experience visual disturbances such as seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots.

Migraines can be extremely debilitating and can interfere with daily activities, leading to feelings of frustration, helplessness, and hopelessness. The pain and discomfort associated with migraines can also disrupt sleep patterns, which can further exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression. Additionally, the fear of experiencing another migraine attack can cause anxiety and stress, which can, in turn, trigger more migraines. Therefore, it is<br \/>\nimportant for individuals with migraines to seek appropriate treatment not only for the physical symptoms but also for their mental health. Some of the means by which migraines affect health are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><b>Anxiety and depression: <\/b>People with migraines are more likely to experience anxiety and depression than those without migraines.
