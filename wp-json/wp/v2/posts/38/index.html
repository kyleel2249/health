As we let out our first cry as babies, we are surrounded by people to whom we give the biological right and ability to make us shed heart-wrenching tears for the rest of our lives. Let\u2019s say some family members explore this ability way too much and unapologetically so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #3c434a; font-family: 'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: initial;\">Talking about apology, is it just me or family members just don\u2019t apologize? Family members can commit actions that should be punishable by law against you and just for the mere fact that you share some DNA, they think everything should be forgiven, forgotten and never spoken of. One particular set of people comes to mind, our parents! I won\u2019t even begin to mention ways our parents hurt us before it gets a bit too personal. (that\u2019s a topic for a different blog post). Anyway, sometimes I wish our parents would just stop playing God and acknowledge the fact that they are humans who can make mistakes too. We get that they care about us. We get that they want the best for us but thinking they owe us <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>no apology for the pain they cause<\/i><\/a> just because they birthed us seems unfair. We always hear the quotation\u00a0<em style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: initial;\">\u201cChildren obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

Sometimes, children even take the blame for situations that are clearly the parents\u2019 fault, but we\u2019re taught to just shut up and say sorry to our parents whether or not we are right. We seem to be fostering an <a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>\u201cAdults don\u2019t apologize\u201d<\/i><\/a> culture which we might end up passing on to our children. We must respect our parents no doubt. If for nothing at all, they at some point provided food for us to eat to say the least but should they be above reproach? I see people go about their lives carrying the burden of pain caused by parents. To think that a lot of family feuds would easily be resolved if parents were to say the words \u201cI was wrong, I\u2019m sorry\u201d<\/p>\n<figure style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: white; color: #3c434a; font-family: 'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; margin: 0px 0px 1em;\">\n<div style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: initial;\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-radius: 6px; display: inherit; height: auto; margin: 0px auto; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media.giphy.com\/media\/229A2YOOsD6MGM2HGc\/giphy.gif?ssl=1\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #3c434a; font-family: 'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: initial;\">It\u2019s not easy being hurt as an adult by your parents. As a child, you\u2019re very forgiving. You make excuses for your parents even but as you grow, as you know better, as you weigh both sides of the story, and as you become more assertive, it gets harder especially when you believe wrong doesn\u2019t become right with age. When you feel people regardless of age, grade, authority or relationship should be responsible for their actions, or that you want to explain your side of the story too. You risk being labeled disrespectful. So we have a bunch of respectful but bitter and hurt children walking around.<\/p>\n<p style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #3c434a; font-family: 'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: initial;\"><br style=\"-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\" \/>With family, we get the stick and stay tag, a tag that arguably supersedes the \u201ctill death do us part\u201d tag. We must make this sacred blood relation worth it. We must look out for each other and be the first to want to mend broken and tense relationships. I believe whenever there\u2019s a misunderstanding between children and parents, both sides have a point. We should be ready to talk about issues. It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to treat the other party fairly and speak honestly. Parents, admitting you\u2019re wrong doesn\u2019t make you any less of a parent. You don\u2019t suddenly lose your authority or respect just because you apologized. Children, I encourage you to speak up, respectfully of course. Sometimes, your parents may not take it well, but I assure you, you\u2019ll be heard. And let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t get disowned for speaking up. I wish you luck!<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>CONFLICT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0LIFESTYLE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAMILY FEUDS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PARENTING<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">____________________________________________________<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, we don\u2019t get to choose our family members.
