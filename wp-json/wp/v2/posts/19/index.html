I had one of those weekends that send you 10 steps back on your healing progress. This particular one hurts because I feel I brought it on myself although it was a classic unintended consequence to a well-intended action. I should have been strong-willed and not have allowed myself to be taken for granted, objectified even! \u00a0My head\u2019s messed up and I even hate myself a little bit. I bet I\u2019m not making sense, but I can\u2019t bring myself to talk about it. It\u2019s all on me so I won\u2019t waste your time ranting about it. All I can say is, sometimes the people we love just love themselves more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Anyway, being single is hard and I was wondering how it feels for men. Do they go through all the emotional pain we do? Do they cry? Are there regrets? If I\u2019m to judge from my ex\u2019s experience, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a cruise for men. He has a way of being very convincing with his words but very aloof with his actions when it comes to our breakup and how he\u2019s holding up. But that\u2019s fine, guys never really deal with breakups, they just carry on with their lives. Well, today I want to share a friend\u2019s journey and I really want to hear from other guys in the comments section. He\u2019s been single for 5 years and It\u2019s kinda making my 3 months look like a joke but pain is pain lol. \u00a0Anyway, read all about it below\u2026<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEg42If0OIHp6UV89eJGd96evC5OPUpOVvDW4-1eAelFv4AZqqHeSPNKimqExDpe6XLZwwf4IhByyd-NCktaTXiRIYqvMzGD3hoS-NlNfRTU1WuWoKzKT1Sfd_CKgWR8NngmbYq3vsRbrLZAnwZgnsByxCaW82VHY11vZBGGggD-uPGfEXeKVrgeijEAvg\/s480\/giphy%20(3).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEg42If0OIHp6UV89eJGd96evC5OPUpOVvDW4-1eAelFv4AZqqHeSPNKimqExDpe6XLZwwf4IhByyd-NCktaTXiRIYqvMzGD3hoS-NlNfRTU1WuWoKzKT1Sfd_CKgWR8NngmbYq3vsRbrLZAnwZgnsByxCaW82VHY11vZBGGggD-uPGfEXeKVrgeijEAvg\/w640-h518\/giphy%20(3).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"518\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"388\" data-original-width=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">Hello Candid Viberz (Can I call you guys that? Lol)<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.875em;\"><span style=\"color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-size: 19px;\">It\u2019s been almost 5 years since I had a special someone in my life. It almost feels like being single is normal. Do not get me wrong, I have enjoyed being single. It gives you a lot of time to get yourself together. But truth be told, no man is an island. I must say that in these past few years, a lot has gone both right and wrong. I have met amazing people, cut some people out of my life, gotten my spiritual life back on track and the list continues. However, one thing I have noticed is that there are those low moments you get that you just cannot seem to come out of, no matter how much you pray, talk to someone, or even distract yourself with other things. It is these moments that you should cherish the most because that is the only time your mind can see the clearest and think the sharpest.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">They say, \u201cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\u201d, well this Jack has been dull for a very long time. Just to clarify, I am not trying to say that finding someone special would have made a difference these past years, however, I am not disputing that it could have. \u00a0What I am trying to say instead is that, being single or being alone is not all that bad, but if you let yourself believe that it is then you are only making it worse. Let\u2019s talk about the social life, you know, going out and meeting new people. Yeah, I suck at that. It\u2019s not even the going out part that is hard, it\u2019s the meeting new people part. Funny thing is that I am a very social person, but only around the people I feel comfortable around. I am what they call an introverted extrovert. That\u2019s not a thing by the way, but you get my point.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhRJAvZu6miqiw0emCHaFUS1EGAiz-Z7U48xpvobXbgWjfkvSyaSi9d-pAaQBlfsQXJkBELWWH9FRhWDIi5FrBiTNsdIaa1TENV3ySpuZnrAQUcC8rCW30m01mx7VDhbD5W6Bf0bIX2dp-FqqyCjrQ7Ibn7-yspa4e-21w88eeGgFk3r1yUUICtEKEBIQ\/s480\/giphy.gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEhRJAvZu6miqiw0emCHaFUS1EGAiz-Z7U48xpvobXbgWjfkvSyaSi9d-pAaQBlfsQXJkBELWWH9FRhWDIi5FrBiTNsdIaa1TENV3ySpuZnrAQUcC8rCW30m01mx7VDhbD5W6Bf0bIX2dp-FqqyCjrQ7Ibn7-yspa4e-21w88eeGgFk3r1yUUICtEKEBIQ\/w640-h360\/giphy.gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"270\" data-original-width=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">So back to the love stuff. Am I seeing anyone? Do I have someone my eyes are on? Do I plan to make any moves on anyone? Do I see marriage in my future and all that? Well, no, no, no, and yes. Just kidding, no, yes, no, and yes. I have spent a great deal of time following the whole social norm of the guy being the one to chase the girl to get the happy ending. I have a new concept, if I like you, I will do my best to let you know, but as to what happens after that is completely up to you. I\u2019m tired of putting in so much effort and not getting the same energy back. It really drains your energy when things don\u2019t go the way you would have hoped for. By that I mean when you start having those you know \u201cshe\u2019s the one\u201d thoughts only for you to end up being you and yourself back at square one.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEgPSQXcudsSN7aAOGZbr1rBd8xz5DSqf3H69qNSra-mtnEfbgL_qaMXAyNFLNH8m58Fgxnf9P1wSDr136c0uJv0nU-nRLT6QOG4xXzev6WmdyVyWJbFjDoxJZmKYy86tYQvO_oy0-NmEomTMQaIG5R2FdIES_qaoiAIsNHFDXwVddzBAz40XKvHz5fNtw\/s450\/giphy%20(1).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEgPSQXcudsSN7aAOGZbr1rBd8xz5DSqf3H69qNSra-mtnEfbgL_qaMXAyNFLNH8m58Fgxnf9P1wSDr136c0uJv0nU-nRLT6QOG4xXzev6WmdyVyWJbFjDoxJZmKYy86tYQvO_oy0-NmEomTMQaIG5R2FdIES_qaoiAIsNHFDXwVddzBAz40XKvHz5fNtw\/w640-h354\/giphy%20(1).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"249\" data-original-width=\"450\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">So where do I stand on all this love stuff or dating stuff? To be very honest I do not know. It\u2019s like one minute I want it and the next, I am just indifferent. I am not exactly the talkative type, but I know how to keep the conversation going if I want to or if I am enjoying it. Other than that, it takes quite a lot to get words out of me. It is my self-defense mechanism; it keeps me from spilling too much. I am very picky with whom I open up to because frankly these days, the only person you can ever trust is yourself, and God of course. Anyways I cannot say for sure I like the new me, but I do prefer the new me to the old me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"background-color: white; color: #383838; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0.875em;\">P.S.<br \/>\nA certain someone gave me the courage to write this, and I must say this person has been quite an amazing friend in the little time we have known each other.
