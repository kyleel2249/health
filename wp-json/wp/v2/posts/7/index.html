Humphrey Fellowship Program has opened its annual call for applications for the academic year 2023\u20132024, and the Public Affairs Division of U.S. Mission Ghana is delighted to make the announcement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">A Fulbright exchange, the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program develops leadership skills among foreign professionals who work together to address regional and global issues and promote change for the benefit of all. This expanding international network exchanges best practices and develops expertise in key areas for cooperation, such as law and human rights, public health, including infectious diseases, climate change, and public policy, through academic study and professional development with U.S. counterparts. The program lays the groundwork for long-lasting, fruitful relationships between Americans and their professional counterparts in other nations, such as Ghana, by giving aspiring leaders and decision-makers experience in American higher education, society, culture, and professional organizations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The Humphrey Fellowship is a mid-career, non-degree program for professionals interested in developing their leadership skills and learning more about their professional fields of study, unlike the typical Fulbright and most other foreign scholarship programs. The Humphrey Program also places a strong emphasis on the sharing of information and understanding regarding topics that are relevant to both the United States and the countries of the Fellows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em;

Aside from attending seminars and conferences, fellows are also expected to fulfill a six-week professional affiliation requirement. They are also expected to participate in professional development activities off the campus of their university.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Many universities organize fellows into professional disciplines. Since there are nearly as many different nationalities represented in current Humphrey cohorts as there are Fellows, in addition to learning about American culture, Fellows must also take into account the traditions and customs of other cultures. Someone who can adjust, be flexible and tolerate diversity is needed for this.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM<\/h2>\n<div>Academic Study Without a Degree: Humphrey Fellows pursue specialized study programs at affiliated host universities, where the lack of degree requirements allows each Fellow the option to follow a self-directed, unique program at a host university. Following a competitive selection procedure, roughly 13 campuses in the United States were chosen based on their capacity to provide institutional and professional resources to host cohorts of Fellows in specific fields of study. Humphrey Fellows cannot ask to be placed at a certain university. At least one designated faculty coordinator for academic and administrative support is present on each site. Faculty advisors also help Fellows pursue well-balanced academic and professional programs. (Note: Humphrey Fellows are not permitted to switch during their program from non-degree to degree status.)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Leadership and Professional Development: Professional visits, skill-enhancement seminars, conferences, training courses, and professional affiliation are some examples of professional enrichment activities (placement). The professional affiliation offers full-time, first-hand exposure to a U.S. workplace for a minimum of six weeks. By providing a global perspective to issues in their respective disciplines, these professional affiliations enable Fellows to actively contribute to American communities while strengthening their relationships with American colleagues. Each Fellow creates, early in the academic year with the help of the local campus coordinator and faculty advisors, a comprehensive schedule of practical professional activities tailored to the Fellow&#8217;s program goals.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">AREAS OF STUDIES<\/h2>\n<div>The objectives of Mission Ghana and the following study areas are in line with US foreign policy.
