Unpatched vulnerabilities in software or systems can leave businesses open to attack, as attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to vulnerable machines or networks. To prevent zero-day exploits, businesses should regularly update their software and use intrusion detection systems to detect any suspicious activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;\">Man-in-the-middle attacks (MitM):\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">communication between two parties to eavesdrop on or alter the information\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">being exchanged. In this type of attack, the attacker positions themselves\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">between the victim and their intended target, allowing them to secretly\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">intercept, modify, or steal sensitive data such as login credentials, credit\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">card numbers, or other sensitive information. MitM attacks are a significant\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">threat to businesses as they can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">reputational damage. They can occur through various techniques, including\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">phishing emails, network interception, and rogue access points, among others.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This type of attack can be particularly damaging for businesses that handle\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">sensitive information, such as banks, healthcare providers, and government\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">agencies. To prevent MitM attacks, businesses can take several precautions,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">including using encryption protocols, multi-factor authentication, and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">conducting regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities in\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">their systems.
